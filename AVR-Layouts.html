                During Program Mode, instructions can be written into the SRAM chip on the FPGA for the WIMP AVR to perform during operating mode. 
                Instructions are written to the SRAM chip manually with binary using 16 switches. 
                The switches were used to set the instruction information and the address in the SRAM the instruction was written to. 
                The 7 segment displays on the FPGA were used to display instruction and memory address information.
                The valid instructions that the WIMP AVR can perform are listed in the table below.
                Incorrect instructions may cause the WIMP AVR to perform unexpected operations.

            </h2>
            <p class = description>
                During Operating Mode, the WIMP AVR will start in an idle state.
                The processor is activated by activating the master switch.
                Once the master switch is activated, the processor will start at address 0 and execute the instructions written in the SRAM chip.
                The 7 segment displays were used to display information stored and read by the processor.
                The clock of the processor can be controlled by using the clock control switches and then selecting hte clock set key.
